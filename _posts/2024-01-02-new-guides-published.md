I decided to merge the **[debug-recipes repository](https://github.com/lowleveldesign/debug-recipes)** with wtrace.net and at the same time convert the recipes into **wtrace.net guides**. I spent some time updating and polishing them and I hope you will find the new format nicer and more readable. The guides are available at **[wtrace.net/guides](/guides/)**.

As we just entered 2024, let me wish you peace, happiness, and positivity in the new year. And, of course, many successes in your troubleshooting endeavors :)
