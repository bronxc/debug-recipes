I am **Sebastian Solnica**, a software engineer with over 15 years of experience. Debugging, profiling, and application security have always been my primary interests. I've created this website to share tools and resources that I hope will help you in your diagnostic adventures. If you need assistance with any software acquired here or have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me at **[contact@wtrace.net](mailto:contact@wtrace.net)**.
