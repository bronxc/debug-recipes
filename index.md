## Hello fellow diagnosers!

I created this site to share with you notes and tools that I have created during my career as a software developer and troubleshooter. They do not contain much theory but rather describe tools and scripts with some usage examples. You may find them in the [**guides**](/guides/) section. I try to update them with the new things and techniques I learn.

The tools I like most are portable applications: easy to deploy, straightforward to use, but insightful at the same time. I try to create applications in this genre. Some are [already published](/tools/), and some are in development or still in my head. I will use the newsletter to post updates, so please [**subscribe**](/subscribe/) if you're interested.

I hope you will find the materials helpful. Please visit the [about](/about/) page if you wish to contact me.
