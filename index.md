## Hello fellow diagnosers!

I created this site to share with you notes and tools that I created during my career as a software developer and troubleshooter.

The tools I like most are portable applications: easy to deploy, straightforward to use, but insightful at the same time. Sysinternals (especially Procmon) are great examples of such utilities. I try to create applications in the same genre. Some are [already published](/tools/), and some are in development or still in my head. I will use the newsletter to post updates, so please [**subscribe**](/subscribe/) if you're interested.

The [**guides**](/guides/) section contains my troubleshooting guides and field notes.

I hope you will find the materials helpful. Visit the [about](/about/) page if you would like to contact me.
