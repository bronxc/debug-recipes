## Hello fellow diagnosers!

I hope you agree that learning troubleshooting tools and techniques benefits many IT roles. In my IT career, I spent significant time chasing issues in applications, learning troubleshooting tools, or writing my own troubleshooting scripts and applications. 

The tools I like most are portable applications: easy to deploy, straightforward to use, but insightful at the same time. Sysinternals (especially Procmon) are great examples of such utilities. I try to create applications in the same genre. Some are [already published](/tools/), and some are in development or still in my head. I will use the newsletter to post updates, so please [**subscribe**](/subscribe/) if you're interested.

The [**guides**](/guides/) section contains my troubleshooting guides and field notes authored by me.
