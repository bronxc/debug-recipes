Debug Recipes
=============

https://github.com/lowleveldesign/debug-recipes/tree/archive


It is a repository of my field notes collected while debugging various .NET application problems on Windows (mainly) and Linux. They do not contain much theory but rather describe tools and scripts with some usage examples.

**The :floppy_disk: icon before a section name means that materials in a given section are no longer updated and may be outdated.**

I hope you will find the materials helpful. Any contribution is welcome.

:point_right: I also authored the **[.NET Diagnostics Expert](https://diagnosticsexpert.com/?utm_source=debugrecipes&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=general) course**, available at  Dotnetos :hot_pepper: Academy. Apart from the theory, it contains lots of demos and troubleshooting guidelines. Check it out if you're interested in learning .NET troubleshooting. ðŸ‘ˆ

General advice
--------------

I prepared a short guide on configuring Windows for effective troubleshooting, so please [check it out](https://wtrace.net/guides/configuring-windows-for-effective-troubleshooting/). If you are debugging a .NET application you may also [check the .NET debugging tips](clr-debugging-tips.md).
